### Introduction

Game Engines are used to make games you can say if you want to make games first you need to make a game engine from scratch or pick an existing one if you are a game developer you definitely know some game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, etc.

Almost all games you can divide into the following phases

- Graphic design ( Artwork, Animation, Particle, etc. )
- Game Logic development ( AI, Physics, Level design, etc.)
- Music design (Game music, Objects sound, etc.)

Now you need software that needs to combine all the above phases. You can make it one or select one game engine because it has all the above properties you do not need to choose a game engine for each of your games. You can make various games with the single game engine.
