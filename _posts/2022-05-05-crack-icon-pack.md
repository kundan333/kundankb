# Icon pack app.



### What is an icon pack?


I want to make my android apps icons look better so I searched on the play store for the icon pack application I found various apps that provide good icon packs. I was developing android apps at that time so I also wanted to know how these apps were made so I searched for open-source applications I found one [Candy Bar library](https://github.com/danimahardhika/candybar-library)  I studied their code and then I thought maybe I can make one so I made one [Crack icon pack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icon.pack.crack&hl=en&gl=US)

I used Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to make icons. I enjoyed it very much and learned much from designing icons. 





#### Type of icons

When we see our phone we don’t notice much about icons but you can notice you have various types of icons in your android phone. Some are following


- Icon back
- Calendar Icons





### How to install the Icon pack?

Our android phone has a launcher that shows our home screen but we can’t change much on our default launcher. For example, we can’t change icons with our default launcher you can install one launcher from the play store that will provide you with various customization settings.
