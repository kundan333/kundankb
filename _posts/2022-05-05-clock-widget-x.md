## Fully customizable clock

I searched for clocks on the play store find many but noticed many of them don’t have a second hand and we can’t customize much in those clocks.
So I thought let’s make one with full customization. I love polishing my math skill in this app all logics are around math.


### Why second hand is big deal?

In android, google supports those apps that take less battery. In the higher version of Android, there is also a battery optimization option so the user has to manually change the setting for an app that is running in the background. In this app, we need to run the service in the background so we can run the clock every time that is not the case if we only have a minute or hour hand because we have to refresh our clock each second we have to run the service.


### How much we can customize the clock?

You can customize each part of the clock here we have 3 circles, 3 clock hands, and hour text you can change all of them to your custom color.



### How to add a widget?

Android has a widget tool that shows on the home screen. First, hold touch on the black home screen then you will see the widget option then choose clock widget x drag it to the home screen you will have your customized clock.
